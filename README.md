# devBoard - A Project Management Hub

devBoard is an ongoing project collaboration tool designed to facilitate efficient organization and management of project tasks, while effectively monitoring assigned team members. Presently, it offers a kanban-style board that enables seamless organization and tracking of tasks. As the project evolves, devBoard is anticipated to incorporate additional features, such as an inspiration board for pinning ideas and concepts, as well as a messaging system tailored for project members.

I'm in the process of re-writing devBoard.
